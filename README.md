# Flex - A CSS GUI

### Background and Overview

Flex is a visual and interactive approach to CSS styling. Flex allows the user to draw on a canvas, and then convert that into functional CSS code.

### Functionality & MVP

In Flex, users will be able to:
* Divide up a canvas into boxes, which are converted into real flexboxes
* Customize their boxes by rezising and adding text
* See the CSS generated from their canvas updated in real time
* Export a copy of the CSS code when they are finished
